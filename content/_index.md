    # A description for the paper.
#    description: The radioactive element astatine exists only in trace amounts in nature. Its properties can therefore only be explored by study of the minute quantities of artificially produced isotopes or by performing theoretical calculations. One of the most important properties influencing the chemical behaviour is the energy required to remove one electron from the valence shell, referred to as the ionization potential.

# Bio

I'm an experienced AI Framework Engineer and Deep Learning Researcher. I specialize in developing efficient and scalable artificial intelligence solutions, leveraging my expertise in High-Performance Computing (HPC), computer architecture, and advanced deep learning methodologies. I also have experience in tracking and debugging performance and accuracy issues in AI workloads as well as compiler technologies like LLVM and MLIR. 

With a strong background in computer science and a passion for driving innovation in the field of AI, I've dedicated my career to creating state-of-the-art AI frameworks that enable developers and researchers to build powerful and efficient applications. My unique skill set in HPC and RISC-V architecture allows me to optimize AI frameworks for the latest hardware, ensuring maximum performance and energy efficiency. 

Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in Data Science at La Sapienza, University of Rome, under the guidance of Professor Fabrizio Silvestri. My research focuses on deep learning and algebraic topology applied to hypergraphs.

I hold an MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Engineering from the University of Rome, La Sapienza. My exceptional thesis centered on drug repurposing using network medicine to develop treatments for COVID-19.
